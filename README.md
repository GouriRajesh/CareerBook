# CareerBook
CareerBook is a platform that provides service to candidates applying to jobs as well as the companies looking for new candidates. The candidate profile has multiple options of creating a resume, applying to jobs at a click of the button, taking up mock aptitude tests and can also sending queries to the companies. The business profile on the other hand can post new jobs and the selection of candidates has been made fully automatic to save valuable time and remove any sort of discrimination. When a candidate is selected or rejected, they receive a confirmation email regarding the same to remove any space for misinformation.
